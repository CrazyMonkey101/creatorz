      <h2> Why I am a sad and lonely fellow </h2>
      <p> I am so sad mostly because I like cheese. Cheese is like a drug, and it will get you addicted. If so, then there is nothing you can do, and you will be like me </p>

      <h2> Why I hate math </h2>
      <p> Math is really bad because it requires SO much work. It is annoying to have to do so much work, and is really depressing. Also, I am failing math at school, so that doesn't help me love it any more. </p>

      <h2> Things that I enjoy </h2>
      <h4> (Yes, they do exist) </h4>
      <p> I like sitting in my room by myself and eating junk and watching youtube. I do this because it is the only solace in life that I have. Other than that, I like to wallow in my self pity and be depressed. It calms me... </p>
