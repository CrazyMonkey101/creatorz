      <h2> Current Status </h2>
      <p> Currently, our planet is in jeopardy. The polar ice caps are melting, which is causing the sea levels to rise. Some experts predict that within 50 years, if the sea levels rise at the current rate they are, New York and most of Florida will be underwater. Also, due to greenhouse gases, temperatures are increasing steadily, which is terrible. Fires and droughts are at a record high, and farming land is becoming dry and cracked. Within the last decade, over 20% of all the world's species have gone extinct. Sadly, our world leaders are denying climate change, so nothing is happening. Many young leaders are trying to lead protests, but figures of power like President Donald J. Trump are shutting them down. If we want to save this planet, we need to do something, and fast. </p>

      <h2> What We Can Do </h2>
      <p> In order to POSSIBLY prevent the fast-approaching destruction of civilization, there are a few things we can do. First of all, we can limit the usage of electricity. Electricity still runs on a lot of fossil fuels, and by  turning off the lights and only showering for 5 to 10 minutes (I'm looking at you, Dad), we can save a LOT of fossil fuels. Next, we can just stop using fossil fuels. There are plenty other ways to get energy, which are listed below, which don't require us to burn up the ugly black fossils just to shower with hot water. IF we stop using gas cars and switch to electric, this will also save energy. Air travel also releases a lot of CO2, so by minimizing this, we can also slow down the tearing of the ozone layer. While I do admit that even I don't use all of these strategies, if we all work together, we can save Earth. </p>

      <h2> Some Good Role Models </h2>
      <p> While there are some people who criticize activist's actions, there are some leaders who are very helpful and have the right ideas. Greta Thunberg and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are well known figures, but there are plenty others. For example, Helena Gualinga is an Ecuadorian activist who has been fighting large oil companies in the Amazon for her entire life. Also, Tekanang, from Tuvala, has been an activist fighting climate change to prevent his small home island from getting flooded and the reefs destroyed. Penny Tovar is an instagram influencer from Oregon who teaches people the importance of a vegan diet and makeup that doesn't attack the ozone and is cruelty free. These are just a few activists who are very strong, and truly care about the safety of our planet. </p>
