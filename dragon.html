      <h2> Current Status </h2>
      <p> Currently, our planet is in jeopardy. The polar ice caps are melting, which is causing the sea levels to rise. Some experts predict that within 50 years, if the sea levels rise at the current ratethey are, New York and most of Florida will be underwater. Also, due to greenhouse gases, temperatures are increasing steadily, which is terrible. Fires and droughts are at a record high, and farming land is becoming dry and cracked. Within the last decade, over 20% of all the world's species have gone extinct. Sadly, our world leaders are denying climate change, so nothing is happening. Many young leaders are trying to lead protests, but figures of power like President Donald J. Trump are shutting them down. If we want to save this planet, we need to do something, and fast. </p>

      <h2> Why I hate math </h2>
      <p> Math is really bad because it requires SO much work. It is annoying to have to do so much work, and is really depressing. Also, I am failing math at school, so that doesn't help me love it any more. </p>

      <h2> Things that I enjoy </h2>
      <h4> (Yes, they do exist) </h4>
      <p> I like sitting in my room by myself and eating junk and watching youtube. I do this because it is the only solace in life that I have. Other than that, I like to wallow in my self pity and be depressed. It calms me... </p>
